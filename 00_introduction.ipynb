    "# EPFL Data Science - Machine Learning: Capstone Project - Artwork Analyser\n",
    "\n",
    "## Author: Paul Williams\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "The Catagorization of Works of Art (Specifically 2 dimensional works of art such as paintings, drawings, cartoons, etchings and sketches). <br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals \n",
    "\n",
    "__GOAL 1__ Identify the the Artist that created the selected Work of Art. <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "__GOAL 2__ Atempt to identify both the _Genre_ & _Style_ of the Work of Art. <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "__GOAL 3__ Recommend visually similar Works of Art that would complement the chosen Work of Art \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source\n",
    "All text and image based data is copied from the <a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en\">__WikiArt.org__</a> website (_English Edition_)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Artwork Text Based Data\n",
    "During the webscraping process, text based data about the artworks is collected. This includes:\n",
    "- Artist Name\n",
    "- Artwork Title\n",
    "- Created Year\n",
    "- Style\n",
    "- Genre\n",
    "\n",
    "## Artists Body of Work Data\n",
    "From the Text Based Data details of the Artist _Body of Work_ can be extracted. Such as:\n",
    "- The percentage of the artworks produced by an Artist are of a particular Style.\n",
    "- The percentage of the artworks produced by an Artist are of a particular Genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Image Data\n",
    "Once the image files of the aertworks have been downloaded, data is extracted using the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Method 1__ The images will be resized to a thumbnail size and features generated using: https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_100_96/feature_vector/3. For each image 1280 features will be created. <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Method 2__ Images will be resized and reshaped then cut up into a grid of 64 equally sized tiles. Each tile will then have features generated using: https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_100_96/feature_vector/3. for each tile 1280 features will be created. So, collectively 81920 features will be held for each Artwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Method 3__ RGB (_Red, Green, Blue_) colour information will be extracted. Each image will be resized to 100x100 pixels (10000 pixels). The RGB values will be extracted. Each colour will be mapped across the value range 0-255 (256 colur levels). These will be combined into a set of 768 colour levels. <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Method 4__ Colour Palettes will be generated from each Work of Art. The Paletted will be created with the use of KMeans Clustering. A standard Palette of 16 coulous and a large Palette of 96 coulurs will created for each Work of Art. The colour feature values of these Palette will be able to be viewed as either RGB (_Red, Green, Blue_) and HLS (_Hue, Luminence & Saturation_).\n",
