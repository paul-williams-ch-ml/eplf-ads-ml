    "- Higher resultion images would provide more detail.\n",
    "- Contolled lighting when taking photos of the images would provide better colour accurancy.\n",
    "- Smaller tile size/larger number of tiles. The tile size was limited by processing resourses availabe and time. A greater number of tiles would allow closer focus on detail. (The number of tile is itself a custom Hyperparameter).\n",
    "- More consistancy in the labelling of Genre & Style. For Genre only one value is given, whereas for Style sometime multiple values are given. Maybe if additional Genres were given it would be better. For instance a _Portrait_ could easily be defined as a _Regious-Painting_, a _Mythilogical-Painting_, or even a _Nude_Painting_. Another case is when does a _Landscape_ become a _Cityscape_.\n",
    "- A larger dataset with more examples of the more obsure Styles & Genres. Again, the biggest limiting factors here are processing resources and time."
